I take great pride in work but over the past several months I’ve realized that despite all my success I am completely alone. I’m looking for something deeper to fill the void. I’m not sure about myself sexually and I’m hoping to meet someone who will be kind and okay with that. I probably won't message you first. I can be shy.")
